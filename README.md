# Netflix Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing Netflix TV shows and movies data to uncover insights into viewing trends, content popularity, and other key metrics. The analysis was conducted using data obtained from Kaggle, and the results are visualized through various charts and graphs.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and includes information on Netflix TV shows and movies. Key features of the dataset include:

- **Title**: The name of the TV show or movie.
- **Type**: The type of content (e.g., Movie, TV Show).
- **Release Year**: The year the content was released.
- **Rating**: The IMDb rating of the content.
- **Duration**: The duration of the content (in minutes for movies, in seasons for TV shows).
- **Genre**: The genre(s) associated with the content.
- **Description**: A brief synopsis of the content.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze the Netflix dataset to achieve the following objectives:

1. Identify trends in the types of content available on Netflix over time.
2. Determine the distribution of genres and their popularity.
3. Explore the relationship between release year and content ratings.
4. Visualize key metrics to provide actionable insights for content strategy and viewer preferences.

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned using Pandas to handle missing values, correct data types, and ensure consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted initial exploration to understand data distributions and identify patterns.
3. **Visualization**: Created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent trends, distributions, and correlations.
4. **Analysis**: Interpreted the visualizations to derive meaningful insights and trends related to Netflix's content.

## Conclusion

The analysis revealed several key insights:

- **Content Trends**: There has been a notable increase in the diversity of content types on Netflix over the years.
- **Genre Distribution**: Certain genres are more prevalent and popular compared to others, influencing content recommendations.
